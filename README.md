# ECE-146-Project-1

This is a project I created for my network engineering class at Fresno State.

It is a simple chat program written in Python, consisting of both a server script and a client script.

## Usage

1. Run server.py and give a port number as an argument (i.e. in console: 'py server.py 1997').
2. Run client.py and give the ip address and port number of server as arguments (i.e. in console: 'py client.py 192.168.x.x 1997').
